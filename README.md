This is the readme file for BlackHole.py. Curently this Module determins what os you are using
(which determins where the host file is), lets you enter a FQDN, and then if it is a new name,
adds it to that file. Main issues are the lack of error checking and no ability to modify entries if 
it is alreadt in there. I'll work on that tomorrow.
